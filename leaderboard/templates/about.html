<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    This is an attempt to improve the leaderboard of the mobile game Subterfuge.
</p>
<p>
    I download the official leaderboard once a day to provide a history.
    I only started with archiving on the 25th of September this year.
    There is some older data avalible that was downloaded from the web archive's wayback machine.
    Data for the week from 25th Sep 2017 to 3rd Oct 2017 was taken from the repository
    <a href="https://github.com/AlexJF12/subterfuge-python/tree/master/data">AlexJF12/subterfuge-python</a>.
    If you happen to have historical leaderboard data in any shape, I would be happy if you would get in touch with me.
